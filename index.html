                CHILDHOOD
              </figcaption>
              <p>Childhood was a time of endless curiosity and innocence. I spent my days exploring the world with wide-eyed wonder, whether playing outside with friends, imagining grand adventures, or getting lost in creative activities like drawing or building. There was a simplicity to life back then, where joy came from the little things—catching fireflies, riding bikes, or just being around family. Everything felt safe and carefree, and the days seemed to stretch on forever, filled with discovery and the belief that anything was possible.</p>

                Teenage years were a whirlwind of change and self-discovery. I was learning who I really was, navigating the ups and downs of emotions, friendships, and school. There was a constant push for independence, trying to figure out where I fit in the world while balancing the pressures of expectations and my own desires. I experimented with different interests, styles, and ideas, often feeling torn between wanting to stand out and also belong. It was a time of exploring passions, questioning everything, and experiencing the thrill of newfound freedom, all while still trying to understand my place in the bigger picture.

              <p>Adulting is a phase of balancing responsibilities and self-discovery. It's about finding stability in work, relationships, and personal growth, while navigating the complexities of life. The carefree days of youth are replaced by practical decisions, but there's also a deeper sense of purpose and understanding. The challenges of adulthood often bring moments of reflection, learning how to manage both the big-picture goals and the small, everyday joys. It’s about becoming more grounded, embracing imperfections, and realizing that growth is a continuous journey, not a destination.</p>

                <p>
                    Call of Duty: Mobile (CODM) has become one of my favorite indoor hobbies, offering an exciting mix of strategy, skill, and adrenaline. Whether I’m playing solo or teaming up with friends, the fast-paced action and variety of game modes keep me hooked. I love the thrill of intense gunfights, working on improving my aim, and mastering new weapons and tactics. The game offers a perfect blend of challenge and fun, and it’s an easy way to unwind while staying engaged. It’s more than just a game—it's a way to connect with friends, compete, and always push myself to get better.

                <p>Basketball is one of my favorite indoor hobbies because it combines physical activity, strategy, and teamwork. Whether I’m shooting hoops alone or playing with friends, there’s something incredibly satisfying about the rhythm of the game—dribbling, passing, and shooting. It’s a great way to stay fit and sharpen my focus, while also having fun in a competitive setting. The intensity of the game, especially during close matches, keeps me fully engaged and constantly striving to improve my skills. Basketball is not just about scoring points; it’s about communication, collaboration, and pushing myself to be better with every play.</p>
